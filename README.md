# Implicit Languagemodels
This repository contains the code for our publication, [**"Implicit Languagemodels are RNN: Balancing Parallelization and Expressivity"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07827).

### ICML 2025 Spotlight
ðŸŽ‰ðŸš€ We are delighted to announce that our paper was spotlighted at ICML 2025! ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰

### Description

- The `implicit_llm` folder is importable when this repository is installed as a package. The core implementation of implicit models is defined in `implicit_llm/implicit.py`.
- Model architectures are defined in the `hf_models` directory.
- Examples for downstream evaluations can be found in `examples/downstream_evaluation.py`, while an example of improved state-tracking (S5) is provided in `examples/state_tracking.py`.
- State-tracking datasets for Figures 1 Top Left/Top Right and Figure 3 in the paper are available in the `state_tracking` folder.
- An example how to calculate the implicit Jacobian as discussed in Theorem 1 (see also A2 and Figure 7) is provided in the implicit_jacobian notebook.
